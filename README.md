# Guidelines
Some guidelines to follow when participating in [Kind Politics](https://t.me/KindPolitics) discussions.

To propose changes to these guidelines, simply [edit this file](https://github.com/KindPolitics/Guidelines/edit/accepted/README.md) and then create a new [pull request](https://docs.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) into the `accepted` branch. Don't forget to tell the community about your changes!



## 0 - This is a community-run group

This means that anyone and everyone in the community is welcome to interact on the same playing field. Administrators exist to ensure bots, trolls, and spam accounts are removed as appropriate, but anyone and everyone can and should help enforce these guidelines.

This also means that, if you want to be given administrative permissions, simply ask any existing administrator! You may also have the rest of the community elect you to that title if you so choose.



## 1 - Your emotions are important

Take care of yourself! Please take a step back when you get overwhelmed.


### 1.1 - Note for systems

If you're an [alter](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Alter) in a [plural system](https://pluralpedia.org/w/System) and you feel a trauma [switch](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Switching) coming on, please close this chat. Switching is okay, but nobody wants to [trigger](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Trigger) a trauma switch.


### 1.2 - Note for singlets coping with trauma

If you're a [singlet](https://pluralpedia.org/w/Singlet) who is coping with trauma, anxiety, etc., and you feel like a conversation will trigger an anxiety attack, panic attack, or similar, then please close this chat.


### 1.3 - In the event of an emotional crisis

If a discussion was too rapid to be able to stop a panic/anxiety attack, trauma switch, or similar, please directly contact any member of the group to begin a discussion about how to prevent such things in the future. Don't forget to bring that discussion or its results to the group so that everyone can be made aware of them.



## 2 - Keep it civil
This place is for discussion and debate, not anger, nor vitreal. Anyone who creates a hostile atmosphere will be muted. No grudges nor interpersonal conflicts here; leave all that at the door.

Trolls, bots, spam accounts, and other such things will be banned. If you think you've been banned for such a reason, contact any member of the group to resolve the mistake.
